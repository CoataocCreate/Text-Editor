# Project Architecture

## Components
- User Interface (UI): Implemented using Tkinter for cross-platform compatibility.
- Backend: Handles file operations, text editing, and user interactions.
- Persistence Layer: Manages data storage and retrieval for opened files.

## Interactions
- User interacts with the UI to open, edit, and save text files.
- Backend processes user actions and updates the UI accordingly.
- Persistence layer manages file storage and retrieval operations.

## Design Principles
- Separation of concerns: UI, backend, and persistence layer are decoupled for modularity and maintainability.
- Scalability: Designed to handle large text files efficiently.
